> Kay's rules: if composition of gas is known.

## Sutton method
Calculate $P_{pc}$ and $T_{pc}$ when composition is known, based on SBV equations.

Sutton's **gas specific gravity** correlation for estimating $P_{pc}$ and $T_{pc}$ when composition is known, based on 634 composition for 275 PVT reports.

## Kay's mixture rules
For multicomponent mixtures.
