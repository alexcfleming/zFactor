  abstract     = {The use of evidence-based practices in education has been gaining a lot of attention in recent years. Researchers often use meta-analyses to identify evidence-based practices. To conduct meta-analyses of studies employing single-subject experimental research (SSER) designs for the purpose of identifying evidence base for a practice, a necessary step is to obtain raw data from published graphs. One method for obtaining raw data from published S. S. E. R.  graphs is the use of computer programs specifically designed to extract data from graphs. Purpose of the present study was to examine the reliability and validity of three data extraction programs, Ungraph, GraphClick and DigitizeIt, using 60 graphs obtained from 15 S. S. E. R.  studies focused on a practice. Three coders extracted data from the graphs using the three pro-grams. Values extracted by each coder were compared to (a) each other (reliability) and (b) values re-ported in the original articles in which the graphs were obtained from (validity). Results showed that raw data from SSER graphs can be obtained reliably using all three data extraction programs and values obtained using the three programs are highly valid. These results suggest that researchers can use data extracted using these programs with a high level of confidences while conducting meta-analyses of studies employing SSER designs. Authors make recommendations for improving the accuracy of data extraction using the three programs.},

  abstract  = {Gas compressibility factor (z-factor) is an important parameter widely used in petroleum and chemical engineering. Accurate and fast calculation of this parameter is of crucial need and challenges a large number of simulators used in petroleum engineering.
The Standing–Katz chart was published in 1942 and since then has been considered an industry standard. Several methods have been tried and developed to calculate z-factor by fitting models on the smoothed Standing–Katz data. Some of these models are the Dranchuk and Abou-Kassem (DAK), the Nishiumi–Saito, the Nishiumi, and the Brill–Beggs correlations. All models developed afterwards the Standing–Katz charts present some limitation like instability close to certain boundaries, convergence, and/or accuracy. In fact, different correlations tend to fit better to a particular area of the domain for Ppr and Tpr (pseudo-reduced pressure and temperature), but fail badly close and beyond to their limits. Also, most correlations require iterative procedures to obtain the corresponding z-factor, and may even present different results dependent on the initial guess for the initial iteration. The DAK correlation is one of the most widely used models.
In this study we propose and develop a methodology to obtain z-factors for Natural Hydrocarbon Gases using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Data obtained directly from the Standing–Katz and Katz compressibility charts were used to train several topologies of ANN. The input parameters in the ANN are the pseudo- reduced pressure and temperature and the output is the z-factor. Two of the successful networks have two hidden layers. The first ANN uses five neurons in each hidden layer and the second ANN uses ten neurons in each hidden layer (called 2-5-5-1 and 2-10-10-1 networks respectively). These topologies were trained with the data from the charts using a back-propagation training algorithm. The results are compared with the charts (with values not used during the training section), along with the results obtained using DAK correlation. In addition, performance comparisons were made between the ANN model and the DAK correlation. In both situations, the ANN models are superior to the DAK correlation. In addition, the ANN model covers a wider range of Ppr and Tpr, which surpasses the limits of all other correlations together. Typically, the time needed to obtain results for a 2-5-5-1 network corresponds to the time of one single iteration needed for the DAK correlation. The paper discusses these results, and provides the weight sets (values of synapses and biases) needed to reproduce the ANN, which can be easily implemented in an electronic spreadsheet.},

  abstract      = {In this study, a multilayer normal feed-forward artificial neural network with three layers has been developed for prediction of compressibility factors of gases with different compositions. This model was developed using 977 experimental data of compressibility factors obtained from the literature. In this model, some statistical criteria such as R2, root mean square error (RMSE), and average absolute deviation (AAD) are obtained 0.991, 0.024, and 0.965, respectively. Model validity was obtained by comparison between the experimental results and the results of various equations of state, such as van der Waals (1910), Redlich-Kwong (1949), Lawal-Lake-Silberberg (Lawal, 1999), Peng-Robinson (1976), and pseudo-experimental correlations such as Dranchuk-Abu-Kassem (1975), Dranchuk-Purvis-Robinson (1974), Hall-Yarborough (1973), Brill-Beggs (1974), Shell Oil Company (2003), Gopal (1977) obtained result of this model. It can be inferred that the results of this model are compatible with the experimental data and the obtained result of this model is more accurate than other correlations.},

  abstract      = {The compressibility factor of natural gases is necessary in many petroleum engineering calculations. Some of these calculations are the following: evaluation of a newly discovered formation, pressure drop from flow of gas through a pipe, pressure gradient in gas wells, gas metering, gas compression, and processing. Typically, the gas compressibility factor is measured by laboratory experiments. These experiments are expensive and time-consuming. Occasionally, experimental data became unavailable and the gas compressibility factor is estimated from correlations using gas composition or gas gravity. This paper presents new methods for calculating the gas compressibility factors for gas condensates at any temperature and pressure. The method is based on compositional analysis of 1200 compositions of gas condensates collected worldwide. When the gas composition is known, this study presents a simple mixing rule to calculate the pseudo-critical properties of the gas condensate. The new mixing rule accounts for the presence of the heptane plus fraction and none hydrocarbons. In case the gas composition is unavailable, the study presents a new gas gravity correlation to estimate pseudo-critical properties of the gas condensate. This study also presents an evaluation of eight methods to characterize the plus fraction, three widely used mixing rules, and six methods to calculate the gas compressibility factor. Thus, this study presents an evaluation of one hundred forty-four possible methods of calculating the gas compressibility factor for gas condensates. The accuracy of the new mixing rule and the gas gravity correlation has been compared to other published methods. The comparison indicates that the proposed methods are consistent and provide accurate results.},
